# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* bundle install

* After registering the bot on slack note the Slack API token, 

* run with SLACK_API_TOKEN=... bundle exec ruby slackbot.rb. Have the bot join a channel and send it a hi.
